I am An Nguyen, and I am a college student ready to take on the world through coding.
And projects of course.

print("Hello World! My name is Python.")
System.out.println("Hello World! My name is Java.");
echo("Hello World! My name is PHP.");
alert("Hello World! My name is JavaScript.");
<p> Hello World! I am written in HTML </p>
